Is there such a thing as a random event? 
What if we had a big atom machine to model all the atoms in the universe, would it be possible to predict everything? 
Are we really living in a random world, or “God doesn’t play dice”? 

If we simplify things, an event like Russian roulette or coin flip might be considered random. The outcome calculation in perfect conditions for a fair coin flip usually gets Heads/Tail = 0.5 percent each, but we tend to believe the outcome is random. 
What if we could measure all the factors of the coin state and conditions like air resistance, starting point, tossing velocity, coin weight, etc. would we know the outcome? 

In the computer science algorithm course, you learn that computers, with software only, can’t really create a pure random number. The software must have an initial value and a deterministic program. From a human perspective, running the program a million times might get a million different numbers, but does it mean is is a random result?

But why is it so important to decide whether we live in a random or predictable world? 

This is what I want to explore and share with you.
