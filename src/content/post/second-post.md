Is there such a thing as a random event? 
What if we had a big atom machine to model all the atoms in the universe, would it be possible to predict everything? 
Are we really living in a random world or “God doesn’t play dice”? 

If we try to over-simplify things, an event like Russian roulette or coin flip might be considered random. The outcome calculation in perfect conditions for a fair coin flip usually gets Heads/Tail = 0.5 percent each, but we tend to believe that the final outcome is a random result. 
What if we had the ability to measure all the factors of the coin state and conditions like air resistance, starting point, tossing velocity, coin weight, etc. would we know the outcome? 

In the computer science algorithm course, you learn that computers, with software only, can’t really create a pure random number. The software must have an initial value and a deterministic program. From a human perspective, running the program a million times might get a million different numbers, but it doesn’t mean it’s a random result. To generate a better pseudo-random, the software, for example, can use a time-based value or even an external computer source like noise, but even so, is that really a random sequence?
